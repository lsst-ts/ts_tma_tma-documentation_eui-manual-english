### SETTINGS

In the "Settings" screens there are three levels of settings. Each level is identified by a different color:

- Orange ("Written"): when the "SAVE" value and the current value are different. Its purpose is to have a temporary value, for specific tests or moments, without losing the good value. The settings marked in orange are saved in the database along with the "SAVE‚Äù values. These are the so-called "Temporary" values. These values will be used by the subsystem.

- Blank ("Saved"): when the current value corresponds to the value stored in the database as definitive. These values will be used by the subsystem.

- Red ("Modified"): when the value has been modified in the window, but no further action has been taken. This value is not stored in the database and is therefore not used in the subsystem. This value is lost if the window is changed.
