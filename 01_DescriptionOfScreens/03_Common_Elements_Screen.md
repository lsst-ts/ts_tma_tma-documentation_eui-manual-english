#### Statuses

There are multiple different statuses in the application, and all of them are accompanied by a representative color.
This section explains the three most common ones with their respective colors:

- **Grey**: Means that the system is off. This status is known as "Idle".

- **Green**: Means that the system is on. This system is called "Enable".

- **Red**: Means that the system has a fault. This status is given the name “Fault”, but it can also be accompanied by
  the name of the fault itself.
