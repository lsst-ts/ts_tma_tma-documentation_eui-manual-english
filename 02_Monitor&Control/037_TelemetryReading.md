#### Telemetry Reading Screen

This screen allows an analysis to be performed of locally saved telemetry. The telemetry available for this window is 1
hour. However, there are 2 days worth of telemetry stored locally. To access data older than 1 hour, the telemetry files
must be unzipped and saved in a different location. Indicate this location when loading the data, for access to this
older data.
