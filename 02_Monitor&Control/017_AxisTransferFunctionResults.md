#### Axis Transfer Function Results Screen

This screen displays the signals picked up through the ["Axis Transfer Function"](./016_AxisTransferFunction.md) screen. It allows the results to be analysed for the Azimuth and Elevation axis transfer function.

##### Axis Transfer Function Results Screen -- Time Signals

In this case, it shows the characteristics of the test and data pickup against time.

##### Axis Transfer Function Results Screen -- FFT

This screen displays a FFT graph of the previously selected signals. The result is plotted on two separate graphs of magnitude and phase versus time.

##### Axis Transfer Function Results Screen -- Transfer Function

This screen displays a graph of the transfer function of the pre-selected signals. One signal must be selected on the Y-axis, and the other on the X-axis. The result is plotted on two separate graphs of magnitude and phase against time.
