#### Axis Transfer Function Screen

This screen allows the selected axis, Azimuth or Elevation, to be excited, in order to get the transfer function from it and then adjust the corresponding controller.

<p>Enables manual entry of the resolution values for frequency (in Hz), amplitude (in deg), and number of
averages.</p>
<p>Enables manual entry of the values of speed (in deg/s), acceleration (in deg/s) and acceleration (in deg/s<sup>2</sup>), stabilisation
time (s) and jerk (deg/s<sup>3</sup>), when a movement is selected for the test.</p>
<p>Shows the values calculated based on the values specified in the controls above. These are: the
test time (in s), the movement time (in s), the initial position (in deg) and the final position (in deg).</p>
<p>Softkey “EXECUTE”: Executes the test defined in the settings, by exciting the selected axis, Azimuth or
Elevation, and displays the values in real time on the graph.</p>
<p>Softkey “STOP”: Stops the test.</p></td>
